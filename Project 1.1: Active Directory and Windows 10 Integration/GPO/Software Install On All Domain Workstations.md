1. Create a folder to host the applications. In this instance, we will create `SoftwareDistribution` inside `C:`
2. *Right-click â†’ Properties â†’ Sharing tab*
3. Click `"Advanced Sharing"` button <sup>[(Walkthrough on How to Share)](https://github.com/nickbruggen90/LabsVol8021Q/blob/main/Project%201.1%3A%20Active%20Directory%20and%20Windows%2010%20Integration/Quickguides/Quickguide%3A%20Fixing%20Network%20Share%20Permissions.md)</sup>
4. Tick `"Share This Folder"` and choose `Software$` as the share name
5. We will need to add permissions. Click the `"Permissions"` button in the same window as Share This Folder
6. Remove any existing groups or users, and add `"Domain Admins"` with Full Control and `"Domain Users"` with Read-only capabilities
7. Next we need to navigate to **Group Policy Management**. *Run â†’ gpmc.msc* (or locate it in the start menu apps, or search)
![group policy management](https://github.com/nickbruggen90/LabsVol8021Q/blob/main/Project%201.1%3A%20Active%20Directory%20and%20Windows%2010%20Integration/Images2/Screenshot%202025-07-20%20073712.png)
8. In this instance we will create a Global GPO. It will be inherited by all child directories underneath it.
9. *Right-click â†’ Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here*
10. Name it `"Computer Config - Software Installation - Adobe Reader"`. Then you will see it populate under the root domain.
11. *Right-click the newly created GPO â†’ Edit â†’ Action â†’ Properties â†’ Comment tab*. Below is example comment:
```

12. Pressing `OK` will take you back to the "Computer Config - Software Installation - Adobe Reader" GPO Editor  
13. Choose *Computer Configuration â†’ Policies â†’ Software Settings â†’ Right-click Software Installation â†’ New â†’ Package*  
14. In this simulation we will use File location: `\\DC01\Software$\AdobeReader.msi`, in your lab or production choose the desired executable  
(NOTE: ðŸ‘‰ GPO Software Installation only supports MSI installers. For .exe files, use a startup script or deploy via SCCM/Intune.)
