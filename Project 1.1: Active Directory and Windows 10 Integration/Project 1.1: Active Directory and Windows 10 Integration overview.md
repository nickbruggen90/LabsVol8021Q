## üîÑ Workflow Overview  
1. **Domain Controller Setup:** Windows Server 2025 configured as primary DC with testlab.local domain
2. **Network Configuration:** Static IP assignments with proper DNS hierarchy (DC: 192.168.83.150, Client: 192.168.83.151)
3. **User Management:** Created organizational units, test users (jsmith), and security groups (IT Support)
4. **Client Integration:** Windows 10 Pro workstation successfully joined to domain with user authentication
5. **Group Policy Implementation:** Account lockout policies, password requirements, and network drive mapping
6. **Security Hardening:** Implemented enterprise-standard lockout thresholds and password complexity requirements
