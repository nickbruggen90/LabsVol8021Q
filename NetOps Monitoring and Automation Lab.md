# ðŸ§ª **Project 1: NetOps Monitoring & Automation Lab**

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective  
Design a GNS3-based lab simulating a secure branch office with VPN access, SNMP/Syslog monitoring, packet analysis, and Python-driven automation workflows.

---

## ðŸ§± Lab Components  
- **Cisco Router (IOSv/IOU)** â€“ Core routing + SNMP/Syslog source  
- **pfSense Firewall** â€“ VPN gateway (OpenVPN or IPSec)  
- **LibreNMS VM** â€“ SNMP monitoring + Syslog collection  
- **Python VM** â€“ Runs Netmiko + TraceNG scripts  
- **Wireshark** â€“ For live packet capture and traffic analysis

---

## ðŸ”„ Workflow Overview  
1. VPN tunnel established from client to pfSense firewall  
2. LibreNMS polls SNMP data and logs events via Syslog  
3. Python/TraceNG VM performs reachability tests and path tracing  
4. Netmiko scripts automate device queries and configuration  
5. Wireshark captures VPN, control, and test traffic for validation

---

## âœ… Skills Demonstrated  
- VPN tunnel configuration and testing  
- SNMP and Syslog server setup  
- Real-time network monitoring and alerting  
- Python-based network automation (Netmiko + TraceNG)  
- Packet analysis and telemetry interpretation
