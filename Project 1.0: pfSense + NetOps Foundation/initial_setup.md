### pfSense Creation and Initial Configuration
1. First we will create the pfSense VM with VMWare Workstation. Use the official pfSense CE .iso release. Choose the following configuration for set-up:
```
2 NICs are needed:
  - NIC 1: Bridged
  - NIC 2: Host-Only
2 GB RAM
20 GB storage space
1 processor, 2 cores
```
2. Once the VM boots up, pfSense will ask input for configuration options. The ones you need to pay attention to are:
```
Auto UFS
MBR partition scheme
```
3. After the installation and initial bootup, pfSense CLI will prompt you will a numbered menu.
