### Virtual Network Editor
`Inside VMWare Workstation Pro we need to change the virtual NIC settings to fit the IPAM schema of this lab.`  
[Refer here for IPAM schema](https://github.com/nickbruggen90/LabsVol8021Q/blob/main/Project%201.0%3A%20pfSense%20%2B%20NetOps%20Foundation/IPAM%20Schema.md)

(NOTE: A /29 subnet is the smallest VMWare Workstation allows)

### VM Creation
1. First we will create the pfSense VM with VMWare Workstation. Use the official pfSense CE .iso release. Choose the following configuration for set-up:
```
2 NICs are needed:
  - NIC 1: Bridged
  - NIC 2: Host-Only
2 GB RAM
20 GB storage space
1 processor, 2 cores
```
2. Once the VM boots up, pfSense will ask input for configuration options. The ones you need to pay attention to are:
```
Auto UFS
MBR partition scheme
```

---

### pfSense Configuration
1. After the installation and initial bootup, pfSense CLI will prompt you will a numbered menu.
2. Choose *`Option 2` to "Set Interface(s) IP Address" → LAN → no DHCP → static IP of `192.168.83.226/29`*
3. This will allow you to access the pfSense GUI. Inside your host machine browser access 192.168.83.226
4. pfSense default username is `admin` and password is `pfsense`
