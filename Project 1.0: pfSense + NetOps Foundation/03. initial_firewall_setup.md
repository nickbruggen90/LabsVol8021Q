### Initial Firewall Setup
1. Navigate to the pfSense GUI through the browser
2. Choose *Firewall → Rules* from the drop down menu
3. You will the available interfaces - Floating, WAN, LAN, etc
4. In the previous step we created subinterfaces for each VLAN - BR1_LNX_SRV, BR1_LNX_CLI, etc - we need to create a rule that allows traffic
5. Click *BR1_LNX_SRV → Add↑* <sup>(Choosing Add↑ will add the rule at the top. Firewalls work from top to bottom)</sup>
6. Action: Pass, Interface: BR1_LNX_SRV, Protocol: Any, and the rest are default for now
