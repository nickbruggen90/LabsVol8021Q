### Ubuntu Server Creation and Configuration
1. Create the Ubuntu VM inside **VMWare Workstation Pro**. Use the official Ubuntu Live Server .iso release.
```
2 GB RAM
1 processors, 2 cores
VMNet2 network adapter
default on the rest is fine
```

2. Once it boots up and you reach `Network Configurations`:
```
a. You will choose an IP within the subnet of the VLAN 1. In this instance it will be 192.168.83.2
b. The gateway will be the IP of the VLANs default gateway (VLAN1) - 192.168.83.1
c. 8.8.8.8 will be the DNS server for this lab
```

3. Install `net-tools`. This installs network related CLI commands.
```
a. sudo apt install net-tools
b. ifconfig -a
```

4. Next, let's install SNMP on the Ubuntu server. We will also need to allow SNMP on pfSense in future steps. Inside the Ubuntu Server VM:
```
sudo apt install snmp snmp-mibs-downloader
```
`For human-readable format, you can comment out #mibs in the /etc/snmp/snmp.conf file â†’ `

##### After:

5. Next, let's install Syslog and confirm it's active. Similar with SNMP, we will need to allow it on pfSense in future steps.
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install rsyslog
sudo systemctl status rsyslog
```
![syslog active 1](https://github.com/nickbruggen90/LabsVol8021Q/blob/main/Project%201%3A%20NetOps%20Monitoring/Images/Screenshot%202025-05-31%20071256.png)

6. We must also create and define log files and directories.
```
sudo mkdir /var/log
sudo touch /var/log/pfsense.log
sudo vim /etc/rsyslog.d/10-pfsense.conf
```

7. Add the following lines to the .conf file:
```
if ($fromhost-ip == '192.168.83.226') then /var/log/pfsense.log
& stop
```
8. Last for rsyslog, we need to allow the UDP connection. `sudo vim /etc/rsyslog.conf` and remove the `#` comments from:
```
module(load="imudp")
input(type="imudp" port="514" address="192.168.83.2")
```

9. Restart Syslog with *sudo systemctl restart rsyslog* - and also power down the VM.
10. While the VM is powered down, now is a good opportunity to create a shared folder between the VM and the host machine.
